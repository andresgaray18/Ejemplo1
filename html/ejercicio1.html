    <h1>What is XML?</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>XML stands for E<b>X</b>temsible<b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage</li>
        <li>XML is a <b>markup language</b> much like HTML</li>
        <li>XML was designed to <b>describe data</b></li>
        <li>XML tags are not predefined. You must <b>define your own tags</b></li>
        <li>XML uses a <b>Document Type Definition</b>(DTD) or an <b>XML Shema</b> to describe<br>
        the data</li>
        
        <li>XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designed to be <b>self-descriptive</b></li>
    </ul>

<h1>The main difference between XML and HTML</h1>

<h4>XML was designed to carry data.</h4>

<p>XML is not a replacement for HTML.</p>
<p>XML and HTML were designed with different goals:</p>

<P>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is.</P>
<p>HTML was desingned to display data and to focus on how data looks.</p>

<p>HTML is about displaying informatio, while XML is about describing information.</p>

<h1>XML does not DO anything</h1>

<h4>XML was not designed to DO anything.</h4>

<p>Maybe it is a little herd to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created <br>
to structure, store and to send information.</p>

<p>The following example is a note to Tove from jani, stored as XML:</p>

<img src="../recursos/imagenes/XML.png" height="110px">






<p>The note has a header and a message body. it also has sender and receiver information. <br>
 But still, this XML document does not DO anything. it is just pure information wrapped <br> 
 in XML tags. Someone must write a pice of software to send, recive or display it.</p>
